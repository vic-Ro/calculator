This is a project From The Odin Project's [curriculum]
(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator)

In this project I've worked for the first time with objects and their methods.

It has also been especially useful to implement the methods associated with strings.

You can see this project working here: https://vic-ro.github.io/calculator/
